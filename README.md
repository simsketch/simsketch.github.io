This is my personal homepage with a few links to my work and an extremely brief introduction to coding, like this:

```

{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}

//below is an array of JSON objects

"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
